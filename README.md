# Understanding the robustness of vision-language models to medical image artefacts
The project consists of two core components.

The first involves constructing benchmarks with various image artefacts. It allows you to apply intensity artefactsâ€”including random noise, bias fields, and motionâ€”to original, unaltered images. We implemented it using [torchio](https://github.com/TorchIO-project/torchio) as a reference. You can also apply spatial artefacts such as random cropping and rotation. The benchmark used in this study is avaliable at: [Benchmark](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M7EldoSvxEMZ2jA9wJs52H1-4G2zTU8C?usp=sharing).

The second focuses on applying VLMs in disease detection tasks. It utilizes vision-language models (VLMs), including [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart), [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook), [BiomedCLIP](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT_256-vit_base_patch16_224), and [Llama 3.2 11B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct). You can experiment with various prompts provided in `prompt.md`.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Integrated Framework**: 1) Benchamrk construction 2) Application of VLMs in disease detection 3) Metrics for robustness evaluation

- **Customizable**: Easily extended to other medical fields

## ðŸ§ª Customise Your Own Datasets

1.Build original unaltered images dataset in structure:
```
original_unaltered_images/
â”œâ”€â”€ normal/
â””â”€â”€ diseased/
```
2.Introducing image artefacts following `imaging_artefacts.ipynb` to your original unaltered images to construct benchmarks in strucuture:
```
